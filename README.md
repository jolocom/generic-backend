## NOTE: The Generic Backend is DEPRECATED and outdated.
For the building blocks of an SSI application, see the [Jolocom SDK](https://github.com/jolocom/jolocom-sdk) and [it's documentation](https://jolocom.github.io/jolocom-sdk/1.0.0-rc11/).
For a similar example application, see the [Interactions Demo](https://github.com/jolocom/interactions-demo) (in particular the `service_agent` subproject)

Documentation for the generic backend is currently hosted [here](https://jolocom.slite.com/p/note/RGanceZUjeLQZqGxGrpStJ).

### Node version
The backend should work with node **v10+**
